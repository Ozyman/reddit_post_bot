Good Times Tuesday is one of the /r/raisingKids [Weekly Events](/r/raisingKids/wiki/Weekly_Events).  These posts are made by rkbot every week at the same time.  The general goals of these events are to stimulate discussion and promote community.  The specific goals of Good Times Tuesday are to help remind us of the joys of parenting, and to share ideas of fun things done with our families.

This post is for all kinds of positive stories.  For example:

* Recent accomplishments  (awards won, goals met)
* DIY - arts, crafts or anything else you or your kids made that you're proud of
* Something you did as a family that you all enjoyed
* Something good that happened to you this week
* Something that emphasized the positive things in parenting
* Any story that remind us of the joys of parenting
