Problem Solving Sunday is one of the /r/raisingKids [Weekly Events](/r/raisingKids/wiki/Weekly_Events).  These posts are made by rkbot every week at the same time.  The general goals of these events are to stimulate discussion and promote community.  The specific goal of Problem Solving Sunday is to provide a welcoming space for anyone to discuss "problems" (big or small) they are having in their families.  

This post is for readers who would like another perspective on a difficult family situation.  Please be respectful and considerate of each other.  Everyone's family is different and what works for one child/family might not be the right decision for another child/family.
