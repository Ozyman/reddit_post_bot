The specific goals of FAQ Friday are to help our readers find answers to common questions and to provide a resource for each other and especially new subscribers.

Here are the "rules" for FAQ Friday:

* Recommendations should be put in top level comments.
* 1 suggestion per comment
* Ignore reddiquette for top level comments and just vote up/down based upon whether you agree with the recommendation.
